# Handwriting-Classification
This repository contains an example demonstration of how machine learning techniques can be used to classify handwritten letters provided by the [EMNIST dataset. https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.05373]

The EMNIST-letters dataset contains 145,600 handwriting samples balanced across 26 classes (one class per English letter). In this project we train a convolutional neural network with less than 1 million parameters to classify uppercase and lowercase handwritten letters. Various network architectures were compared to determine the most efficient network type.
